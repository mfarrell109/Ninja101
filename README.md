### Developers:

The **origin/Dev** branch should be the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release. This is where any automated/nightly builds could be built from.

The **origin/master** branch should be the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a *production-ready* state. Only project leads should commit to this branch.

Don't commit to the **origin/Prod** branch.

### Artists:

The **origin/Dev** branch should be where new and modified artwork and resources are committed.
